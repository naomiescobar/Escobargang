As I said before, I speak fluent Spanish. When I arrived to the US I had to learn English.
Now that I speak fluent English I started learning more languages, like Russian, Italian and sign language. 
I also started learning computer science, and thanks to this I learned how to built apps, and web pages from scratch.
